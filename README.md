📜 Brief:
The project started with the UX/UI team from Hyper Island in Karlskrona to interprete, analyze and create a prototype suitable for the international company Ricola.

We started working together and came up with the final prototype pretty soon. While the Front End team were starting to code, UX designers were improving the ideas and adding functionalities to the prototype in Figma.

⌛ Time spent:
4 weeks.

🏁 Goals:
Improve our knowledge about CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Learn about Agile methodology and Scrum and how to apply it to a project like this one with differente teams involved. Deliver a product that our client would like and transmit the values of a company like Ricola.

✔️ Solution:
We decided to create a webpage with the prototype that UX/UI designers had done in vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML withouth frameworks in order to assimilate those knowledges. The images are created mainly with Figma by the UX/UI. We wanted to make the website easy to navigate, intuitive and clickable to the different elements in an inclusive way instead of "obligate" the user to go through all the different steps. You click were you want to click and it will go through the different ideas that Ricola want to transmit.
